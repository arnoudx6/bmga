## Introduction

Welcome to the BMGA GitHub repository, a repository dedicated to a thesis exploring the concealment of botnet communication via generative AI steganography. This research employs design science research (DSR) as its research method. This method facilitates the development of a theoretical model. This model is then tested in the form of an artifact(s), allowing for testing and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the artifacts.

Contained within this repository is a bespoke botmaster, a botnet command-and-control (C2) server, and a bot, enabling the testing of multiple artifacts. Each artifact embodies a distinct method of AI-driven steganography, providing a range of strategies for the covert embedding and retrieval of information within communication channels. The bespoke botmaster, botnet C2 server, and bot have been created for researching generative AI. They are in no way production-ready but do support the multiple algorithms (artifacts) developed in my thesis.

## Repository Usage

- **Code**: The `code` directory houses the source code for the botnet framework and its steganographic algorithms.
- **Thesis Document**: The comprehensive thesis document can be found in the `docs` directory, available for download as a PDF.
